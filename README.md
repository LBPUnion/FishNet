# Project StarShield

Project Starshield is a community-first effort to research and develop a solution to prevent the LittleBigPlanet client from syncing unrecognized FSH resources. In simpler terms, this patch aims to eliminate LittleBigPlanet's remote code execution vulnerability presented by modified scripts in peer to peer sessions.
