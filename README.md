# Project FishNet

Project FishNet is a community-first effort to research and develop a solution to prevent the LittleBigPlanet client from syncing unrecognized FSH (fishfingers) resources. In simpler terms, this patch aims to eliminate LittleBigPlanet's remote code execution vulnerability presented by modified scripts in peer to peer sessions.

## Organization

Project FishNet is a publicly developed effort maintained by the LBP Union Research and Development team. Our intention is that the project belongs to the community, and LBP Union does not own or control any part of the project. Our goals during the research, planning, and development process are:

1. Work with community developers to research and identify the best path forward to develop the Project FishNet patch.
2. Perform code review and promote maintainers who have experience with the topic material.
3. Perform all work on the project within the public eye to promote transparency and accessibility.

## Steps of This Project

The broad roadmap of this project will follow these steps, 

1. Research: understand the LittleBigPlanet client's functionality to identify how a patch could prevent FSH resources from syncing.
2. Develop: create a prototype patch.
3. Test: test the patch for errors and to ensure it works properly.
4. Deploy: create a new patcher or modify UnionPatcher to deploy the patch to the public.
